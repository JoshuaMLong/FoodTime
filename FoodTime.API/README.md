# FoodTime.API
An example backend of a fake company named FoodTime.API

This is a demo project that I am working on to learn and grow myself as a developer. The idea is that there is a parent company
"FoodTime.API" and two child companies: "PastryTime" and "PizzaTime". In future, there will be a front end for each child company, as well as a front end for the FoodTime.API
employees to review orders. Users on the child company front ends will be able to add pastries/pizzas to a cart and checkout (without actually paying).
After checkout I plan to create an order in a sql object named orders and then display that on the "employee site" All of these sites will be hosted using Azure, and I 
will be deploying this backend to a linux machine.
